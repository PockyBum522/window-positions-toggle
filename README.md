# window-positions-toggle
Using (currently) xdotool to snap my windows into the positions I want automatically, depending on what window is currently selected. Works with cinnamon well.

# Prerequisites
```
sudo apt install wmctrl -y
```

## If you want an easy way to call the script with a hotkey:
```
sudo apt install xbindkeys -y
```
